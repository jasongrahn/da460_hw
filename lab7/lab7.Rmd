#The R stuff
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
```

```{r load data, include=FALSE}
download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/mlb11.RData", destfile = "mlb11.RData")
load("mlb11.RData")
```

###What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between runs and one of the other numerical variables? 

I'd use a scatterplot.

###Plot this relationship using the variable at_bats as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a teamâ€™s at_bats, would you be comfortable using a linear model to predict the number of runs?

```{r}
plot(mlb11$runs ~ mlb11$at_bats, 
     main = "The relationship between runs and at Bats", 
     xlab = "At Bats", ylab = "Runs")
```

```{r}

```
