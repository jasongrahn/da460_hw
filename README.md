This is my repro for the R portions of homework assigned to Bellevue College's DA460 class, titled Data Analysis with Software and Programming. The class is generally following all the text from https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php. So if you want to get ahead, or want a college level education for free; dig into that!
